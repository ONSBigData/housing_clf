## Classification of gated communities and caravans within Zoopla Data


### Overview
The project seeks to use Zoopla data to help to identify properties that are either not recorded or are inconsistently recorded in other data sets. This is of particular interest as it will be helpful to supplement the Address Register for such properties and will be a useful resource for field staff

* For this project, the property types of interest are:
    * Caravans, and whether these are residential or holiday
    * Gated communities


### What does it do?
The code relates to classifiers built by members of the Big Data Project to identify gated communities and caravan properties. In order to do this, it relies on a supervised machine learning approach so requires some lablled data, thus if you intend to run this code, please ensure you have a labelled sample. 

The code also uses the most informative features generated by the classifiers to make the classifier more robust and........
 
 
### How do I use it?
This code has been made available for research purposes. You can pull the repository................


### Requirements/Pre-requisites
1. Access to Zoopla data 
2. See list of packages at the top of each piece of code for more information.
